# ESP32localSensors
ESP32 connected sensors accesible from a locally hosted web server. A starting point for those wanting to access sensor information online. The WiFi for this program is in AP mode meaning the ESP32 is its own WIFI router, but some changes with the Arduino IDE WiFi.h library can make it STA (open to the internet).
